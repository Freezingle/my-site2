                            content: `Come Saturday night he’s charged with the task of dethroning popular incumbent Cody Rhodes at Saturday Night’s Main event, which airs free in the UK on YouTube.

Having also feuded bitterly with The Bloodline over the last couple of years, he’s very much been working at the top of the company.

Owens is, to fans, a much-cherished member of the WWE roster, with many eager for him to commit his long-term future amid rumours about his contract status.

Alongside love for Owens, however, has been a fascination with whether or not his son, Owen, will follow in his footsteps and make a go of it in the world of pro wrestling.


Fans predict match will crash WWE Netflix debut as legends set for WrestleMania style show

Kevin Owens issues WWE contract update amid fears ahead of Netflix debut
Owen, at 16, boasts a hugely impressive stature, standing 6ft 7in and 280lb, towering above the rest of the Owens clan.

The father-son precedent in the sporting environment has been set; NBA icon LeBron James paired with son, Bronny, earlier this year and made history by playing together in the LA Lakers’ season opener against Minnesota Timberwolves - the first time in the league's history such a feat has been achieved.

Closer to home in WWE, the obvious example is Mysterio, who performed alongside and against father, Rey Mysterio Sr – firmly establishing himself as one of the company’s top heel (villain) performers in the process.

Owens doesn’t care much for basketball, though – nor the younger Mysterio, giving talkSPORT a firm response on both when asked whether he would be the latest to follow the trend by tangling with his on in the wrestling ring.`,

        content: `WWE is pulling out all stops for the long-awaited premiere of Monday Night Raw on Netflix. The January 6th edition is expected to be historic, and a main event billed as CM Punk vs Seth Rollins has been long rumored to close the show, making this highly anticipated encounter a culmination of a years-long rivalry between two of the best in their sport. Punk and Rollins have a little history, having initially come up in Ring of Honor, where they formed a strong connection and fought against each other multiple times.

In theory, the history between CM Punk and Seth Rollins stretches back deep. Originally speculated to face Rollins at WrestleMania 40 to defend the World Heavyweight Championship, injury forced the withdrawal of CM Punk from the card. Without that match, the WWE remained keen to push the match talk, with each man turning his verbal spittle into explosive promos. On the latest episode of RAW, Punk addressed Rollins' hostility head-on, adding a rich layer of depth to their rivalry with a pertinent personal anecdote. Punk remembered mentoring 16-year-old Rollins for free; the irony does not escape that now this man whom he mentored shows aggression towards Punk.
“Now that entitlement I think has carried over into the adult Seth Rollins you know who wants to be the best in the world he wants to be on everybody’s top 10 list of the greatest of all time but I remember a time when he was on the top 10 list of people to be fired from this place and I shielded him from that you know, I guess if I have to live in my shadow I’d hate me too.”

“11 years ago I called him, I texted him, because I was a friend, and because I respected him and what he stood for, and what did I get back from Punk? Nothing, I got ghosted by CM Punk and it wasn’t just me it was every single person who was friends with Punk.”

While the match card for Raw on January 6th is yet to be announced, the possibility of a Punk-Rollins showdown already has fans abuzz and speculating about what will happen. We can expect nothing but heart-stopping surprises and memories that will be etched in time as WWE marks this historic occasion.`,

        content:`The disappointment has become all greater with the fact that Big E hasn't wrestled since March 2022 due to an apparent neck injury raising concerns about whether he may ever make a return to the ring. Though he has come out, speculating if his retirement would be better dependent on his health, he has also been included in a recent New Day storyline that is being debated on possibilities for a return.
Fans were left heartbroken as Kingston and Woods coldly dismissed Big E, who had once been the heart and soul of their trio. The New Day's rejection of their former leader has added an emotional depth to the storyline and made it one of WWE's most compelling narratives heading into 2024.
This heel turn marks a seismic transformation for the group that has created a legacy as one of WWE's most successful and entertaining factions. Their babyface run of eight years allowed them to win a slew of tag team titles while becoming icons of positivity and fun. With this full embrace of their darker side, fans get ready for a new chapter filled with fresh rivalries and surprising twists.
As fans await further developments, one thing is clear; The New Day's heel turn has freshened up their narrative and revived programming on WWE. Love them or hate them, Kingston and Woods are ensuring no one turns aside.
What is your take on this jaw-dropping turn for The New Day? Let us know in the comments!`,
